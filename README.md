# Learning django from scratch

In the years I tried to learn django more than once, but never had the time to do it consistently. Now I will need to use django for work, so what better reason to start again? 

I will be following the [main tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/) from the django website, to build a poll app.
